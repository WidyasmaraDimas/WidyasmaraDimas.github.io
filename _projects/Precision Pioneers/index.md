title: Bottle Transport Crane
description:  For my Introduction to Engineering Design course, my team and I engineered a custom bottle transport device from concept to functional prototype. The objective was to automatically move three bottles over a one-inch square extrusion barrier. I designed the mechanical components in SolidWorks, validated the structural integrity using FEA, and fabricated the parts using 3D-printing and laser cutting. Finally, I programmed an Arduino to control the servos and motors, enabling the device's automated function.
